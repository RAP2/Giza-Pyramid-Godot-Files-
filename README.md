# Giza-Pyramid-Godot-Files-
Explore Khufu Pyramid Interior using Godot CSG and Sprite3D Text
This is a Godot Game Engine project.
 
Goal: To enable users to explore the interior of the Great Pyramid of Giza using Godot Game Engine, specifically CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) and Sprite3D Text. 

I spent about one month creating the project. The dimensions of the Khufu pyramid interior are approximate. Sometimes, I adjusted the dimensions to fit some special affects. I added some interesting on-sight facts to the pyramid's interior.

The actual Godot file, you will be able to explore the following:

Descending Passage
Ascending Passage
Subterranean Chamber
Grand Gallery
Queen's Chamber (and its air shafts)
King's Chamber (and its air shafts)
Ante Chamber (and portcullises)
Al-Ma'mun's forced entry
Well shafts (and Grotto)
